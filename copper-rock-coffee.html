            <h1>Copper Rock Coffee</h1>

            <p>Located inside of <a href="copper-state-brewing.html">Copper State Brewing Co.</a> is Copper Rock Coffee. Copper Rock Coffee offers a wide variety of coffee drinks as well as some freshly roasted coffee beans. Copper Rock Coffee offer has a couple locations in the Appleton area in case you're staying there or planning on visiting the area and are looking for great coffee.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>Admittedly, I enjoy going to the Appleton locations more than the Green Bay location. I love that we have a Copper Rock Coffee in Green Bay, but it doesn’t seem to offer as many freshly roasted coffee options for sale as the ones in Appleton. I think this has to do with the fact that those two are stand-alone stores, where this is inside of <a href="copper-state-brewing.html">Copper State Brewing Co.</a> The only other criticism I have about going to Copper Rock Coffee in Green Bay is that depending of the time of day you go; you can get a barista who was just somewhat thrown in to work Copper Rock Coffee. I’ve been there a couple different times where the barista had to look at how to make the drink every step of the way. I only bring this up because it can result in a little longer wait for your drinks and/or inconsistency when it comes to your drinks. However, I by no means would let that deter you from going to Copper Rock Coffee.</p>

            <p>Those two criticisms aside, I absolutely love Copper Rock Coffee. Funny enough, I’m drinking a cup of Copper Rock Coffee as I write this. I love the variety of roasts they do and how well they do them. They seem to focus more on specialty, smaller batched coffee. You never know what you’re going to find for roasted coffee when you go into Copper Rock Coffee and that’s what I love about them. As someone who is a coffee nerd, it’s awesome to go Copper Rock Coffee and pick out a new roast to try. It's equivalent to when you were a kid and your mom let you pick out a toy... at least for me.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the actual drinks at Copper Rock Coffee, I’ve never had a single drink there I didn’t like. They have a nice menu that offers something for everyone. They can customize each drink to fit what you’re looking for as well, for example if you’re wanting a different milk in your drink than what it normally comes with.</p>

            <p>All in all, I love Copper Rock Coffee. I’d highly encourage any coffee lover to go check them out and buy yourself a bag of beans to take home with you. I think you’ll be happy you did.</p>

            <p>One final callout, they do also have a couple locations in Appleton that are solely coffee shops. If you're looking to take a bit of a drive and get a damn good cup of coffee, I'd highly suggest giving one of their Appleton locations a try as well.</p>
