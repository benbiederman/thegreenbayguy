            <h1>Black Honey Hashery</h1>

            <p>If you’re coming to Green Bay, looking for hidden gem breakfast places, Black Honey Hashery is the spot you’re looking for. Located in De Pere and somewhat hidden away, Black Honey Hashery has been serving high quality meals and coffee since 2017. I had never heard of Black Honey Hashery, so I was excited to give it a try.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>My first experience and really only criticism for this spot is the parking situation. It’s a smaller parking lot and when it’s busy, it’s tougher to park in it due to the size and flow. My recommendation would be to possibly just park out on the road for easier in/out. I managed to park just fine, but had to maneuver a little more due to how full it was.</p>

            <p>Despite the busy parking lot we were seated immediately. The small area was jam packed full of tables, filled with patrons. We were greeted by a friendly waitress named Lauren. She was bubbly and quick to get our drink order. We received our coffee and learned that they serve <a href="https://colectivocoffee.com/" target="_blank">Colectivo Coffee</a> as their drip coffee. I was excited to learn that they use more of a premium coffee for their drip coffee, rather than some cheap coffee that a lot of diners tend to serve. They also serve bags of coffee if you’re looking to take some with you. Otherwise, if you're feeling extra frivolous, you can order a premium coffee. They even have a drive-thru to get your coffee on the fly.</p>

            <p>When it comes to their food, their biscuits and gravy were the best I’ve ever had. The biscuits, which I assume were house made, were a garlic cheddar biscuit. You know those cheesy biscuits at Red Lobster that are pure bliss? Yeah, just like that for their biscuits and gravy. Their gravy was phenomenal. It was flavorful and smooth, with sausage in every bite. Just writing this is making me want it again.</p>

            <p>Honestly, if <a href="the-pancake-place.html" target="_blank">The Pancake Place</a> is my favorite breakfast place in Green Bay, Black Honey Hashery is my favorite breakfast place in De Pere. This place is that damn good, do yourself a favor and go give it a try.</p>
