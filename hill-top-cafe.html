            <h1>Hill Top Cafe</h1>

            <p>If you're coming to Green Bay looking for hidden gems, this is the restaurant for you. Hill Top Cafe is located on the outskirts of Green Bay, over by UW Green Bay. Hill Top Cafe is hidden inside of a BP gas station, which makes it extra hidden, even from the locals here. In fact, when I asked around, no one at my work had heard of it, let alone been there. Hill Top Cafe is just the type of spot I was looking to try.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>When you step into Hill Top Cafe, er rather the BP gas station, you'll notice that it looks mostly like a normal gas station. The only difference is on the left side of the gas station there are a handful of tables and a counter with a menu board.</p>

            <p>I noticed two things immediately once I got in line for food. The first being that it was really busy in there, the tables in the gas station were mostly full, with few exceptions. The second thing I noticed was how reasonable the prices were. I ordered a bacon cheese burger basket, my girlfriend ordered a regular cheese burger basket - the total of our order was $12. We luckily found an open table and took a seat to wait for our food. After a short wait, our name was called. After receiving our order, I'm still unsure as to how Hill Top Cafe makes any money. Along with the burger, our baskets were overflowing with fresh french fries.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the food itself, once again, I was pleasantly surprised. Your expectations of a restaurant in a gas station usually aren't the greatest, but Hill Top Cafe made me a believer. The burger I had from Hill Top Cafe was one of the best butter burgers I've ever had. The fries didn't disappoint either. They were crispy but didn't lose the chewiness you'd want out of your fries.</p>

            <p>My only real complaint about Hill Top Cafe is that if you dine there, you have to listen to the door alarm go off every time someone comes into the gas station. When I go back in the future, I'm thinking I'll be taking my food to go. One other call out, some of the items on their menu are only offered on certain days of the week. For example, my girlfriend asked about a wrap she saw online, but those are only available on Wednesdays. If you go, maybe have a few food options in your mind of what you'd like to order.</p>

            <p>All in all, Hill Top Cafe was a great spot to go for food. The price paired with the quality/quantity of food made it a nice surprise. If anyone is coming to Green Bay looking for a great butter burger, look no further than Hill Top Cafe.</p>
