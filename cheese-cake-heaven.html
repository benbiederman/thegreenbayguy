            <h1>Cheese Cake Heaven</h1>

            <p>Located within a stone's throw from <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a> is Cheese Cake Heaven. Cheese Cake Heaven offers over 90(!) different types of cheesecakes throughout the year. Along with their delicious cheesecakes, Cheese Cake Heaven offers a breakfast menu, and a lunch menu that consists of sandwiches, salads, soups, and burgers. On this trip, I decided to try their lunch menu this round.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>After browsing their menu online prior to going, I decided I was going to get the Fuhgedaboudit. I've heard great things about Cheese Cake Heaven, I was excited to get my order. We placed our order and the first impression was that it's a little on the pricier side. We ordered my sandwich, a 1/2 sandwich/soup, and a piece of cheesecake. The total came to right around $30.</p>
            
            <p>After a fairly lengthy wait, we received our food. My sandwich was really good. I was happy to see that the quality of the sandwich matched my expectation for it. The bread was very fresh. It was a perfect balance of chewy and crunchy. It was the perfect bread for the sandwich. The cheese itself held it's weight nicely. It didn't over power the sandwich, but rather added flavor to the sandwich without taking anything away from it. My girlfriend ordered a 1/2 grilled cheese and the asiago broccoli cheese soup. She stated she wished she had just gotten a bread bowl of that, because it was that good.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the best part of the meal, the dessert, it was fantastic. The cheesecake was nice and dense. I'm glad we split the piece of cheesecake because it was a nice, rich treat to end the meal. Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts, so I was all about it. I would definitely go again for a slice of cheesecake. If you're interested in the cheesecake, they sell them by the slice of whole cheesecake.</p>

            <p>Overall, the food was great. To us, it felt like a fancy Panera Bread. I don't mean that in a bad way by any means. I'd definitely go back to Cheese Cake Heaven again in the future, but I don't know that it'd be one of my first choices due to the wait that we noticed (I'd say it took roughly 20-30 minutes to get our food) and the price point compared to some other spots in the area. Realistically I'd be more apt to eat at <a href="not-by-bread-alone.html">Not By Bread Alone</a> instead.</p>
