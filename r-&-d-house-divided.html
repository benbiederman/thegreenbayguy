            <h1>R & D House Divided</h1>

            <p>Located on University Ave in Green Bay is R & D House Divided. R & D House Divided is a Packers Bears bar, the one owner being a Packers fan and the other owner being a Bears fan. The concept seemed quite interesting to me, so I wanted to check it out.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>When you step into R & D House Divided you'll see numerous tables and a bar on the front of the building. Don't wait to be seated by someone, you help yourself to a table. The walls are decorated with Packers and Bears items, as you'd expect from a Packers Bears bar. It seems a little heavier favored to Packers stuff, but given it's in Green Bay, that's probably a better idea anyway.</p>

            <p>We were quickly greeted by a very friendly bartender. She was super bubbly and made us feel welcomed. The waitress took our drink orders, which consisted of waters to start. The waitress came back with R & D House Divided bottles of water. I thought it was a little odd that rather than serving glasses of water, they only do $2 bottles of water. It was definitely a first for me in all the food reviews I've done.</p>

            <p>We placed our order for food and received it in a timely manner. I ordered the Italian beef sandwich. Since it's a Chicago themed bar, I thought it'd be somewhat similar to an Italian beef you'd get from Portillo's or Taste of the Windy City (when it was still open in Green Bay). I was wrong for thinking that. The beef on the Italian beef was cut a little bit thicker and just kind of stacked on the sandwich. The Italian beefs I've had in the past have always been more of a thin sliced beef. However, the sandwich was still decent. The general consensus from our party of four was that the food was okay. There wasn't anything that really stood out from what we all ordered.</p>

            <p>R & D House Divided is definitely an interesting concept, but I'm not sure I'd be back too quickly for some food. If it were me, I'd just keep driving down the road and go to <a href="legend-larrys.html">Legend Larry's</a>. The only thing that wowed us during this visit was our waitress. She was extremely bubbly and quick to help. I'd see maybe suggesting this place if you're looking to grab a drink with your Bears fan friend, but that's about it for me.</p>
