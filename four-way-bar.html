            <h1>Four-Way Bar</h1>

            <p>Located in Suamico, and well known for their Friday fish fry is Four-Way Bar & Restaurant. Four-Way Bar & Restaurant is a bar and restaurant (shocker by the name) that has been family owned since 1978, offering a wide-variety of dish options, it offers something for just about anyone.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>Well, when it comes to what to expect, the first thing I'd say is a cluster. I entered the very busy location and walked to the hostess desk. After standing there for a five minutes or so, someone asked if they could help me. I stated that I was interesting in a table. I was advised that I had to speak with the bartenders to get a number, the number would then be the order in which I would be served. I headed over to the very bustling bar to get assigned a number. After waiting a few minutes to get my number, I found a small table to sit at in the bar area. They serve in order of numbers, so once my number came up, a waitress came over and took my order. The food came out very quickly, but we had no drinks. At which point I learned that you ordered from the bar area instead of with the waitress? A while after finishing my meal, I asked the person who took my food order for my bill since I had been waiting for it. She advised that I go to the bar and they cash me out. So I had to go back up to a very busy bar to have the bartenders cash me out. I'm exhausted just typing out the entire process again.</p>

            <p>As far as the food goes, it was decent. The wings were unique, they're breaded like fried chicken, which was better than I had anticipated. It ended up being more pricey than I expected. I ordered 12 wings (50 cents each per the menu), fries, and a coke; my bill came out to $16. The math didn't add up, however, I felt awkward questioning it since the bartenders were slammed and trying to cash me out at the same time.</p>

            <p>As good as the food was, I don't anticipate I'll be coming back anytime soon. It was just too much of a cluster to go through the process, maybe if I had gotten a traditional table in the restaurant it would have been a little more smooth, but it was a mess all around. According to some of their reviews online, I'm not the only one who has experienced this cluster. I hope if you elect to go to this location, you see this review first so you can go in prepared!</p>
