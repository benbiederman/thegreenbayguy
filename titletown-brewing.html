            <h1>Titletown Brewing Co.</h1>

            <p>Located in beautiful downtown Green Bay is Titletown Brewing Co. It's a hard location to miss, especially with the Donald Driver statue out front. Titletown Brewing Co. is located in an old train station, which makes it a cool vibe while you're throwing back some beers named after Packer legends and stuffing your face. Afterwards, when you're feeling good from your meal, you can go walk the Green Bay <a href="citydeck.html">CityDeck</a> and take in the sights. It's a popular spot for people when they come to Green Bay for all of the right reasons.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>You can expect to get a good meal with a unique restaurant feel. The amount of space they have in their restaurant is quite deceiving, so generally you can get a table quicker than you'd think you would be able to, especially in the warmer months due to outside seating. However, if you want to avoid a wait, be sure to call ahead and get put on their list reservation list. Unlike some spots in town, they don't have a minimum person requirement to making reservations.</p>

            <p>Another thing I really enjoy about Titletown Brewing Company is that they don't just focus on traditional beer, they offer a nice line of cider beers as well. As a person who isn't a big beer drinker, it's nice to have the varieties in case I want to indulge in a drink. To go along with their crafted brews and ciders, they also offer crafted rootbeer and cream soda. No matter what you're looking to drink, you can find some high quality crafted beverages.</p>

            <p>Last thing, which I mentioned above slightly, is that you get to see something that I think is amazing and that's the tribute to Donald Driver. They have a statue painted in his honor and they named the street Donald Driver Way. Even if you're not looking to get food, go get a beer or some cheesecurds and check those two things out.</p>

            <p>*Disclaimer - Since writing my initial review, Titletown Brewing Company has changed locations. Don't worry, they didn't go too far, they're now located across the street. Look for the smokestack that says Titletown and you'll find it.*</p>
