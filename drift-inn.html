            <h1>Drift Inn</h1>

            <p>If you’re utilizing this guide as a way to find those hole-in-the-wall places in Green Bay, Drift Inn is exactly the spot you’re looking for. Drift Inn is one of those places that doesn’t get talked about too much, but you never know why. While they may have a menu that offers a wide range of items like burgers, fish, and cheese curds, their lore resides mostly in their chili. Around Green Bay the words Drift Inn and great chili are synonymous.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>Before deciding to come to the Drift Inn, one thing you'll want to do is check their hours. Their hours change by the time of the year. During the Summer, May to end of September, they are open Monday through Friday 11:00am - 11:30pm. During the Winter, October to end of April, they are also open Saturday from 11:00am - 8:30pm.</p>

            <p>When you first head into the restaurant, you'll notice a bunch of tables. Don't wait for a hostess to greet you and seat you, you seat yourself. You won't see a sign that says to do so, but find an empty table and start looking at the napkin holder. The napkin holder? Yep, that's where they have their menu printed. Don't worry, see below, I took a picture of it so you can come prepared. I got you.</p>

            <p>One thing I'd recommend is coming prepared with an idea with what you'd like. Depending on the server you get, they can be quite impatient. They're expecting you to know what you want so they can flip the table quickly. Do your best to have an idea of what you're going to eat right from the start.</p>

            <p>Their food is very simple, but great. As I stated above, they're very well known for their chili. However, they also serve the staples of any good dive bar. I personally don't get their chili, not because it's not good, but because it has onions in it and I have the palate of a seven-year-old.</p>

            <p>One last tip - bring cash. The Drift Inn doesn't take anything but cash. They offer an ATM on location, however, I'm not sure the fees associated with using it. Better to be safe and bring your own fee free cash when you come in.</p>
