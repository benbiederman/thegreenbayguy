        <h1>Luigi's Pizza Palace II</h1>

        <p>Luigi's Pizza Palace II is located slightly outside of Green Bay in Little Suamico. I wouldn't let the drive deter you at all from giving this restaurant a try. Luigi's Pizza Palace II has been family owned and serving up delicious pizza since 1986.</p>

        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>When heading to Luigi's Pizza Palace, I would expect to have a slight wait for your table. We arrived early for dinner on a Friday night and had to wait for 10ish minutes. Not a terrible wait by any means, but it got busier as the night went on. Luigi's Pizza Palace seems quite well known for their fish fry, which isn't something you'd think of from a pizza place. As I looked around the restaurant, I saw a vast majority of people were getting fish. However, when trying Luigi's Pizza Palace for the first time, it's not for fish. I was there for some pizza.</p>

        <p>Along with our pizza, we decided to try their beer nugget appetizers. Beer nuggets are chunks of dough, deep fried with a seasoning sprinkled on, served with a tomato dipping sauce. The beer nuggets were $4.99. I add that piece of information, because the beer nuggets were delivered to us in a bucket. I'm still dumbfounded at the portion size we received on that. I'm quite positive my girlfriend and I could have skipped the pizza and have filled up on beer nuggets.</p>

        <p>After stuffing our face with too many beer nuggets, we were served our pizza. The pizza was surprisingly good. You never know what you're going to get from a pizza spot, but Luigi's Pizza Palace is doing things right. The pizza was very cheesy, and used high quality ingredients. What I especially loved about this pizza was the pepperoni on it. I'm not sure if it's how they cook the pizza or the quality of pepperoni, but the flavor really jumped out of the pizza. The pepperoni was cooked really well, to the point that it was crispy.</p>

        <p>Honestly, after giving Luigi's Pizza Palace a try, it's no surprise that they've been open since 1986. The portion sizes for the price you get is unbelievable. I'll definitely be going back to Luigi's Pizza Palace in the future.</p>
