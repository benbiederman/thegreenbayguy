            <h1>Green Tea Chinese</h1>

            <p>Located on the East side of Green Bay, in an old Sonic building, is Green Tea Chinese. Green Tea Chinese is known for their quick food, reasonable prices, and delicious food. I really enjoy Chinese food, so I'm always excited to check out a new Chinese restaurant.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>The first thing to call out is that from the outside, Green Tea Chinese doesn’t look super welcoming. It’s located in an old Sonic building. Please do not let the looks of the restaurant deter you from giving them a try. Their service, pricing, and food make up for anything that their store front may lack. One unique feature that Green Tea Chinese has, because it is in an old Sonic building, is a drive thru. Green Tea Chinese makes the most of having a drive thru as well. The speed that they execute their orders makes some fast food joints look bad.</p>

            <p>Despite being in an old Sonic building, they still have a few tables inside for those customers that are looking to dine in. Every time I go to Green Tea Chinese, I’m surprised by a few different things – how cheap it is, how fast it is, and how much food you get. I have gotten a few different meals and every time my food is ready by the time I get my water and napkins. The first time I went to Green Tea Chinese I assumed they were so quick because they had it somewhat premade already, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. No matter the dish I purchase, it always seems to be quickly and freshly made.</p>

            <p>The only downside one may encounter from dining in at Green Tea Chinese, if I had to give one, is hearing the drive thru speaker constantly. Ultimately, this is a very nitpicky thing to call out, but I want it to be on here so that if someone knows they’d be bothered by this, they can get the food to-go or go through the drive thru. One thing it’ll make you realize, regardless if the speaker bothers you or not, is how busy they are in drive thru and how quickly they’re serving their food.</p>

            <p>All-in-all, I’m a big fan of Green Tea Chinese. If you’re coming to Green Bay looking for great Chinese food, I’d say be sure to check them out. They’re a nice hidden gem in the city.</p>
