            <h1>Green Bay Packers Ticket Guide</h1>

            <p>If you're reading this, I can only assume you're wanting to go to Lambeau Field, but you're not quite sure how to go about getting a ticket to a Packers game. With a current waiting list of over 130,000 people, Packers season tickets at Lambeau Field are reserved for the elite Packers fans who come from generations of Packer fandom. Thanks to this waiting list and the die-hard fans that accompany it, Lambeau Field has been sold out since 1960. Every. Single. Game. Even during the drought of the 1970's through the 1980's, and especially since Brett Favre lead the team back to the promise land. Since the Favre era, we've obviously been fortunate to have Rodgers take over the team without missing a beat. Tickets to a Packer game have never been more difficult to get.</p>

            <h2>"Can I even get tickets to a Packers game?"</h2>
            <p>Of course. Anyone at any time can get tickets to a Packer game, as long as you have the bank account to back it up. Ticket prices can range anywhere from $102 a ticket all the way to thousands of dollars per ticket, depending on who you know, where you sit, and what game you want to go to. These prices can fluctuate greatly depending on numerous factors:</p>

            <p><b>Opponent:</b> Whether the Packers are playing an NFC North rival or another rival from the NFC such as the Cowboys, Seahawks, or Falcons, the tickets can be inflated in price due to the demand to see these rivals go head to head. Another indication that the prices may go higher is the Packers are playing a team that has a loyal fan base that will be traveling to the game regardless of their team's success, like the Steelers. These factors can increase demand to a game thus increasing price.</p>

            <p><b>Packers Record:</b> While the Packers have been sold out since 1960 despite some horrendous seasons, Packer tickets get significantly easier to obtain when the Packers aren't doing well for one reason or another. For example, in 2017 when Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone and we had to witness the Brett Hundley show, season ticket holders were doing all they could to get rid of their tickets. Prior to the Monday Night game against the Lions, 'fans' were selling their tickets for as low as $20/each.</p>

            <p>However, on the flip side, after Super Bowl XLV the price of tickets shot up dramatically and became harder to find at a decent value. I went from paying $140/ticket for 40 yardline seats to paying $200+/ticket for endzone seats. It makes sense though, people want to go to a game where their team is going to win.</p>

            <p><b>Time of Year:</b> As you already probably know, Lambeau Field is not a dome, with that comes some very unfavorable weather games. A lot of people don't enjoy lounging in a stadium for 3-4 hours when it's 10 below zero and snowing. When the weather starts to get really cold, say around December, depending on the opponent and how the season is going, tickets can become easier to score. I know a few season ticket holders that will sell their tickets when it's too cold for them because they just don't enjoy struggling in that weather.</p>

            <p>Another factor that the time of year can play into things is if it's preseason or post season. During preseason, you can get usually find tickets dirt cheap. I tend to go to every preseason game for $25-30/ticket. I know that not everyone wants their experience to be a preseason game, but it's a way to go to beautiful Lambeau Field without breaking the bank too badly, especially if you have younger children. When it's playoff football, the weather and many other facts that tend to decrease the price of a ticket goes out the window. Playoff football is a different atmosphere that obviously will increase the demand for a ticket since it's a win or be eliminated situation.</p>

            <h2>"Where can I buy tickets?"</h2>
            <p>When it comes to buying tickets, I'm not much of a risk taker. I buy from sources I know that will sell me authentic tickets. I've heard some pretty bad horror stories of people who've purchased tickets for a steep price, only to have them be fake or they're printed tickets that have been printed numerous times, giving the person with the name on the tickets priority to the seats. To me the best place to buy a ticket, for someone who doesn't have connections to tickets at face value, would be a reputable site. A few site examples would be:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.greenbayticketservice.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">- Green Bay Ticket Service</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eventusa.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">- Event USA</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">- Ticketmaster</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.stubhub.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">- Stubhub</a></p>


            <p>As for what site is best out of all of those, I'd recommend that you price check them all. Some tickets may appear cheaper on one site, but could have higher fees when checking out. Do a little research on all of them to determine what is best for you. I know Green Bay Ticket Service doesn't have service fees on their tickets, which can mean big savings when you finally go to add the tickets to your cart.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to potentially score some last minute tickets at a cheaper price, you can always try to work with the people that are buying/selling tickets outside the stadium. Just as a disclaimer, I've never purchased from them before. However, a lot of the time it's the same people selling tickets outside of Lambeau Field, so I can't imagine they're doing anything too illegal, otherwise they wouldn't be there week in and week out. If you're buying tickets from someone, there's going to be a couple things you want to look for with your tickets.</p>

            <p>The first thing you'll want to verify is that it's a physical ticket, not a printed one. Printed ones can be printed/copied a few times, so they can be sold to numerous people. Unless it's someone you know and trust, I'd avoid buying these. They do offer e-tickets now, but I'm not sure entirely how those work. I'm more of a physical ticket fan myself.</p>

            <p>Finally once you've confirmed it's a physical ticket, you'll want to look over the ticket, verify that it has the look/feel of a real ticket. Be sure to check for watermarks on the ticket, as well as perforated edges.</p>

            <p>Another option that Nathan P on Twitter suggested is Craigslist. Depending on where you live, you could potentially utilize Craigslist to secure some tickets at more of a fair price. However, Nathan had some great advice that went with that, <em>"As a resident of Green Bay, I’ve also bought tickets through Craigslist but only when the seller agreed to meet me at the Packers ticket office to sell them. That way I can verify them before buying."</em> I'd say that if you're not in an area where you could go to the Packers ticket office, suggest meeting at your local police station. This way you know it's a safe purchase, you can verify the tickets look legit, and it'd deter anyone who is doing funny business from wanting to sell them to you since you're meeting at a police station.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, it's up to you on how much risk you're wanting to take on when it comes to buying tickets. You don't know want to be one of the unlucky fans that purchases fake tickets, only to be without your money nor valid tickets, left out in the cold.</p>

            <p>There are obviously many options on how to obtain tickets, I hope this guide helped as much as possible. Have any questions I didn’t answer? I’d love to help you as much as I can, feel free to <a href="mailto:thegreenbayguy@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGreenBayGuy/" target="_blank">message me on Facebook</a>, or <a href="sms:9207703933">send me a text</a> and I'd be happy to help answer any questions you have.</p>
