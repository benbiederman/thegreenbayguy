            <h1>The Exchange</h1>

            <p>Located in downtown De Pere is The Exchange Coffee House. Known for their coffee (shocker, I know), The Exchange also offers a sizeable food menu. During this venture to The Exchange I had one mission in mind, to try a flight of coffee.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>A flight of coffee?! Yes. A flight of coffee. The Exchange is the first place I've heard in the area that offers a flight of coffee. When I saw that, I knew I had to try it. I elected to go with the Rich & Sweet flight. It consisted of Caffe’ Macchiato, Affogato, and a latte.</p>

            <p>After placing our order for our flight of coffee, we were warned that it may be 10 minutes or so before it would be ready, which was no problem to us. We were given a number to place on our table, and ventured to find a seat. I was really surprised at how big the location is. It felt like it just kept going. It had a really great vibe in the restaurant. It had a heavy industrial style vibe.</p>

            <p>After a short wait our flight was delivered. Man. It did not disappoint. It was awesome to be able to try a few different coffees without breaking the bank account. The flight ran me around $10 for the one I selected. Each flight has a different price, they even have a build your own flight, so you can try three drinks of your choice. I really enjoyed the Affogato drink we received, which is espresso over ice cream. That made for a nice dessert coffee.</p>

            <p>To wrap this thing up, I'd definitely go back to The Exchange. If I do go back, odds are I'll hammer out another flight. If you're a coffee fiend like myself, I'd highly recommend checking it out and getting yourself a flight of coffee. You won't be disappointed... just caffeinated.</p>
