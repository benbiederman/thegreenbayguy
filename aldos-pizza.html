            <h1>Aldo's Pizza</h1>

            <p>If a hole in the wall place is what you're looking for in Green Bay, Aldo's Pizza could be an option for you. Founded in 1969, Aldo's Pizza has been serving the Green Bay area for over 50 years. I was excited to give Aldo's Pizza a try to see how it fared.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>The first thing you notice when you pull up is that the location looks like an old house made into a restaurant. It didn't really have that restaurant vibe from the outside and if I wasn't set on going there already, I probably would have missed it. We parked and went inside.</p>

            <p>Aldo's Pizza dining area isn't too large, but they utilize the space they have to squeeze as many tables as they can into it. You seat yourself, so don't worry about waiting for someone to show you to a table. The decorations inside are a little bizarre in my opinion, but unique, I guess. The whole place is decorated with The Three Stooges memorabilia. It was definitely not the decorations I'd ever expect in a restaurant, but by no means a deal breaker. I snagged a picture so I could share it.</p>

            <p>For our food we ordered an order of cheese curds as well as their 14x17 pizza, which they're known for in the area. The cheese curds were really enjoyable, but let's be honest... I've never had a bad cheese curd. The pizza itself was definitely different. I don't know that I've ever had a pizza that was rectangular instead of a circle. It was a thinner, flaky crust. They definitely didn't skimp on the toppings either. It was loaded with pepperoni and cheese. It's a pizza I would definitely be happy to eat again.</p>

            <p>One thing that I thought was rather odd about Aldo's Pizza was that when we received our pizza (mind you, we were eating there), we didn't receive any plates. When we asked for plates, we each received one little styrofoam plate that was big enough for a single slice of their square pizza. Not a deal breaker from going there in the future by any means, just a rather bizarre thing.</p>

            <p>All in all, while the food was good at Aldo's Pizza, I'm not sure it's a place that I'd regularly visit. For me, I'd still prefer to go to <a href="rustique-pizzeria.html">Rustique Pizzeria</a> or <a href="heartland-pizza.html">Heartland Pizza</a> if looking for a great pizza experience. However, I wouldn't complain about eating at Aldo's Pizza again.</p>
