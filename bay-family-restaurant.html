            <h1>Bay Family Restaurant</h1>

            <p>Located off of Military Avenue in Green Bay, Wisconsin is Bay Motel & Family Restaurant. Positioned within walking distance of <a href="lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a>, Bay Family Restaurant offers a variety of menu options for a great value. The word family in Bay Family Restaurant really needs to be emphasized. I felt like I was at a restaurant owned by my family. I witnessed the staff speaking to individuals like it was a family reunion. Bay Family Restaurant projects a vibe of an old diner that serves up good comfort food.</p>

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>The first thing you should expect when going to Bay Family Restaurant for breakfast or lunch is that you won't get anything flashy. Bay Family Restaurant is a small diner attached to their motel. Speaking of which, if you're looking for a place to stay when coming to a Packers game, my recommendation is Bay Motel. It's nothing flashy, much like their diner, however it's clean affordable, and close to <a href = "lambeau-field.html">Lambeau Field</a>.</p>

            <p>The food itself was very much a comfort meal, like I was eating at my parent's house. Whether it's breakfast or lunch, you always seem to get some great comfort food that feels like you're back home. One thing about Bay Family Restaurant is that the pricing is always very favorable. I don't think my girlfriend and I ever spent more than $20 during a visit at Bay Family Restaurant.</p>

            <p>All in all, Bay Family Restaurant was a nice spot to grab some breakfast or lunch but it wouldn't be my go-to place if I wanted to dine out and get some food. With so many great options in the area, Bay Family Restaurant wouldn't be first choice. However, if you're staying at the Bay Motel, I'd definitely recommend going to the diner, especially because they give you some money off coupons to the diner. With that said, I'd definitely have breakfast or lunch there again, it just may not my first choice.</p>
